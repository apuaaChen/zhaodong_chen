Welcome! I am a Deep Learning Library Performance Software Engineer at NVIDIA Corporation. I work on [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass), a collection of CUDA C++ template abstractions for implementing high-performance matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) and related computations at all levels and scales within CUDA.

I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) supervised by [Prof. Yuan Xie](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/yuanxie) and my B.Eng and B.Mgt from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My academic work focuses on Deep Learning, Systems for Machine Learning, and GPU parallel programming,
